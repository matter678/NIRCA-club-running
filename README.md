# NIRCA-club-running

This is a project done in class my senior year of college. It contains the files used to scrape the data from clubrunning.org, the data processing and cleaning files, and the visualization and analysis notebooks.
 
### project1.ipynb

contains the creation of the webscraper and the creation of some other variables.

### Updated Scraper.ipynb

as it sounds, this was an updated version of the scraper created in project1. It fixes some errors that were found later, and decreases the load on clubrunning.org's servers as to not cause any disruptions to their service.

### attaching distances.ipynb

depreciated, as the information in the file is part of project2

### project2.ipynb

contains all visualizations and analysis of the dataset created, as well as the process of attaching the distances.
