    "## Question\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use a club cross country dataset containing different datatypes on race results to learn about some underlying tendencies in races and across club running as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "I've run cross country since my freshman year of high school, and track since at least 7th grade. While I've recently developed a chronic injury preventing me from running, I still find the sport fascinating. One of the things I've always thought went underuntilized in the sport was the insane amounts of data generated. Every runner knows their personal bests and where to find them online. Sites like www.milesplit.com and www.tfrrs.org contain hundreds of thousands of times for runners across a decade and a half. For the most part, all of this has gone unused in a scholarly setting. \n",
    "\n",
    "So I'm going to use data from www.clubrunning.org to learn how runners progress as they travel through their collegiate career. \n",
    "\n",
    "www.clubrunning.org is the homepage of NIRCA, National Intercollegiate Running Club Association. It is the governing body of running clubs accross the country, and in 2015 it began to host results on it's webpage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Getting the data from here is much simpler, as NIRCA has far more of a structure to its season than NCAA, where runners may only run one or two races before the championships. In NIRCA it isn't uncommon to see a single runner with 5 races before the championship races begin. This means more data, the most important thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "NIRCA's website is also far more accessible as a central hub for all results. No such 'hub' exists for NCAA results without a paywall. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "NIRCA splits their site into a list of upcoming results that then link to their respective results page when available. My first step should be to gather links to all available results pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that NIRCA has only been hosting results in a consistent format since 2015. Before this, clubs would submit their own results in excel sheets or just distribute results directly to the teams that participated, leaving almost no chance of finding results for many races before 2015."
